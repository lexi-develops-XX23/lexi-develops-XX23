            Simonida SaviÄ‡ (b. Netherlands) works as a multidisciplinary graphic designer, where she translates her research into visual storytelling. By having a variety of interests, including the development of psychedelics and mushrooms, as well as other cultural curiosities, she uses her personal interest as an inspiration for her individual projects. After growing up near the seaside (Katwijk), she has been living and working in The Hague. During her studies at the KABK (2019-2023), she noticed that she finds great interest and curiosity by collaborating with peers and commissioners that are not necessarily engaged in the graphic design practice itself.
