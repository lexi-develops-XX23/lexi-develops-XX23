            Simonida SaviÄ‡ (b. Netherlands) works as a multidisciplinary graphic designer, where she <br> translates her research into visual storytelling. <br> By having a variety of interests, including the development of psychedelics and mushrooms, <br> as well as other cultural curiosities, <br> she uses her personal interest as an inspiration <br> for her individual projects. <br> 
            <br> After growing up near the seaside, she has been <br> living and working in The Hague. During her studies <br> at the KABK (2019-2023), she noticed that she <br> finds great interest and curiosity by collaborating <br> with peers and commissioners that are not necessarily engaged in the graphic design practice itself.
